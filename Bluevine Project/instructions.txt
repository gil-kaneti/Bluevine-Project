How to run the code:
1. To run the code, use the command:
   python solution.py
   Upload the `isbn.txt` file with the ISBNs to the main directory of the repository.
2. Make sure to have the required libraries installed by running:
   pip install pandas requests
3. The code will execute all the questions in the file and log all the information.
   The logger will print the output to the screen and save the results to a text file named `answers.txt`.
   Additionally, if there are any exceptions, they will be logged both on the screen and in the `answers.txt` file.
   For reference, there is already a file named `answers.txt` in the directory showing how the results will appear.
